#### Project Summary: 
The environmental factors below do not signiciantly influence estimates of deer density made from spotlight surveys.  Temperature was found to be the most influential predictor from a multiple linear regression model (MLR) and two machine learning models (random forest and gradient boosting).  The R2 of the selected linear model was poor (~ 0.10).  However, temperature was found to be a statistically significant predictor (p < 0.001).  The selected MLR found that for every 1 degree fahreheit increase in temperature, there was a 0.80 decrease in the deer density. Environmental factors: 

* month of the year (numerical)
* temperature (continuous variable)
* wind (binary)
* cloud cover (index)
* rain (binary)
* snow (binary)
* fog (binary)
* moon phase

#### Dataset: 

I found this dataset through google's public dataset search.  This is deer spotlight survey data collected by the Department of the Interior in Great Smoky Mountains National Park from 1993-2003.
